Visual Studio extension with many features frequently used by  [Lombiq](https://lombiq.com/) developers. Contains [Orchard CMS](https://www.orchardcore.net/)-related (including Orchard Core and Orchard 1.x) as well as generic goodies. For Orchard developers and for other .NET developers alike!

The extension can be installed from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LombiqVisualStudioExtension.LombiqOrchardVisualStudioExtension), including installing directly from inside Visual Studio from under Extensions &gt; Manage Extensions.

Check out the [extension's Readme](Lombiq.Vsix.Orchard/Readme.md) for more info (it's there and not in the root of the repository so it's also accessible from inside VS).

The project's logo was created by [Ulises TJ](https://github.com/tjulises).
