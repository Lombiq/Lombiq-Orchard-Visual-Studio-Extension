![image.png](Logos/Logo.png)


Visual Studio extension with many features and templates frequently used by  [Lombiq](https://lombiq.com/) developers. Contains [Orchard](http://orchardproject.net/)-related (including Orchard Core) as well as generic goodies.

Check out the [extension's Readme](Lombiq.Vsix.Orchard/Readme.md) for more info (it's there and not in the root of the repository so it's also accessible from inside VS).

The project's logo was created by [Ulises TJ](https://github.com/tjulises).
