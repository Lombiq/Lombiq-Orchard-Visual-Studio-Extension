Visual Studio extension with many features and templates frequently used by  [Lombiq](https://lombiq.com/) developers. Contains [Orchard](http://orchardproject.net/)-related as well as generic goodies.

Check out the [extension's Readme](Lombiq.Vsix.Orchard/Readme.md) for more info (it's there and not in the root of the repository so it's also accessible from inside VS).
